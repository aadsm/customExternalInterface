Custom ExternalInterface
========================

This library is a proof of concept of the solution proposed by the "Alternative Method for Message Passing Between JavaScript and Flash" paper.

It is currently being used on the Opera Unite "Media Player" Application to make it work on the Wii. This web-application relies on the SoundManager 2 library that was recompiled into a wii capable version using a previous version of this library.

How To Use It
-------------

In order to make it work with your own Flash-powered web-application you need to follow these, hopefully, simple steps:

1. Comment the "`import flash.external.ExternalInterface;`" line from your *.as and compile it using the `src/ExternalInterface.as` instead.
2. Copy `swf/MessageProxy.swf` to some folder on your web-application.
3. Add this bit of configuration to your web-application:    
`cEIConfig = {
        proxyUrl: "path/to/MessageProxy.swf",
        flashId: "flashDomObjectId"
};`

Technical Information
---------------------

There are issues with too many messages being passed in a short period of time, the Wii has limited memory that is easy to fill up resulting in an OOM error message.

The Flash object needs to be visible all the time, the Wii has an optimization that stops all Flash objects not visible to the user.

Only one flash object per page is permitted to have this hack.
